        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying education.  </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming Education in India</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a crucial tool for social transformation as it can shape individuals’ perspectives, beliefs, and values, leading to changes in attitudes and behaviours within society. It plays a key role in promoting equal opportunities, empowering individuals and communities, and fostering social and economic development.

            There are several concepts associated with education and social transformation, such as critical pedagogy, inclusive education, and lifelong learning. Critical pedagogy aims to promote social change by encouraging individuals to question and challenge the existing social, political, and economic structures. Inclusive education aims to provide equal opportunities and access to education for all, regardless of ability, race, gender, or social background. Lifelong learning emphasises the importance of continuous education throughout one’s life, enabling individuals to continuously develop their knowledge and skills.
            
            However, there are also several issues that need to be addressed in the context of education and social transformation. These include unequal access to quality education, limited funding for education, and a lack of resources for teacher training. Additionally, there is often a lack of political will to invest in education, which hinders its ability to promote social transformation.  </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The history of education studies the processes, methods, and institutions involved in teaching and learning. It tries to explain how they have interacted with each other and shaped educational practice until the present day. Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. For the most part, there were no specialized teachers and most adults taught the youth, usually informally during everyday activities. Education was achieved through oral communication and imitation. It could take the form of storytelling and singing to pass knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. </p>
